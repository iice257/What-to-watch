# What to Watch

A personal movie discovery project by ICE.

What to Watch is built for the exact moment when you want to watch something, but you do not know what to watch. Instead of handing you another flat list, it turns movie discovery into an interactive visual experience: explore a field of films, follow your curiosity, open details, save favorites, and jump out to familiar movie services when something catches your eye.

Landing page: [Coming soon](#coming-soon)

## Why This Exists

Streaming services make it easy to access movies, but they do not always make it easy to choose one. Recommendation rows can feel repetitive, search assumes you already know what you want, and watchlists can become another pile of decisions.

What to Watch is my personal answer to that problem. It is a playful, visual way to browse films when the only thing you know is that you want to watch something. The goal is not to optimize the choice down to a perfect recommendation. The goal is to make browsing feel interesting enough that a choice naturally appears.

## What It Does

What to Watch presents movies inside an interactive WebGL visualization. Film posters are arranged in a force-driven visual space, letting you pan, zoom, inspect, and select movies in a more exploratory way than a normal catalog.

You can use it to:

- Browse films visually when you are undecided.
- Open a movie preview and inspect basic details.
- Move between discovery, preview, and selection states.
- Save movies as favorites for later.
- Add custom outbound links for the movie services or search tools you personally use.
- Tune visual and performance settings for your device.
- Switch between light and dark interface themes.

## Product Focus

This project is designed around a simple user journey:

1. You arrive because you want to watch something.
2. The app gives you a visual field of possibilities instead of another rigid list.
3. You move through posters, colors, clusters, and previews.
4. A title catches your attention.
5. You open it, save it, or follow a link to keep exploring elsewhere.

The product idea is intentionally lightweight: reduce the blank-screen feeling of choosing a movie, and make the browsing process itself enjoyable.

## Core Features

### Visual Movie Discovery

The main experience is an interactive movie canvas powered by WebGL. It is built to make a large collection of films feel browseable, tactile, and alive.

### Film Preview

Selecting a film opens a focused view with movie details and related actions. The app is meant to help you quickly decide whether a title is worth following up on.

### Favorites

Movies can be saved into a local favorites list so interesting titles do not disappear after browsing.

### Custom Links

You can create your own outbound movie links. For example, you can add a custom search URL for a streaming guide, review site, or search engine, then reuse it from any film view.

### Device-Aware Settings

The app includes presets and cell limits to balance visual quality with performance. It can adjust the experience for different device classes, including smaller or less powerful devices.

### Personal Settings

Theme, intro state, visual preset, device class, cell limit, and user configuration are persisted locally so the app remembers your preferences across sessions.

## Who It Is For

What to Watch is for people who:

- Want to watch a movie but do not have a title in mind.
- Prefer browsing and discovery over strict recommendation feeds.
- Like visual interfaces and exploratory tools.
- Keep running into the same suggestions on streaming platforms.
- Want a personal, low-pressure way to stumble into their next movie.

## Current Status

This is an active personal project. The core app experience is present, with a React interface, local settings, favorites, custom links, and a custom WebGL visualization engine.

The public landing page is not live yet.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI primitives
- Zustand for app state
- OGL and custom GLSL shaders for rendering
- Custom Voroforce visualization and simulation engine
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for end-to-end tests
- Biome for linting and formatting

## How It Works

The app has two main layers:

- The React app, located in `app/`, handles interface state, settings, modals, film views, favorites, and user interaction.
- The Voroforce engine, located in `voroforce/`, handles the interactive simulation, rendering, controls, media loading, and WebGL scene.

Film data and poster media are served from the `public/` directory. The React layer connects to the visualization engine through the store and the `app/vf/` integration layer.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm are used by the toolchain.
- A modern browser with WebGL support is required to run the app properly.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Start The Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview A Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev                 Start the Vite development server
npm run build               Type-check and build for production
npm run preview             Preview the production build
npm run lint                Run Biome linting

```

## Configuration

For local development, copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Useful environment values include:

```bash
VITE_TEXTURES_BASE_URL=/media
VITE_FILM_INFO_BASE_URL=/json
VITE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
VITE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=
VITE_APP_VERSION=
```

## Data And Attribution

Poster thumbnails are prepared ahead of deployment and served from
`public/media/posters/`. Run `npm run media:posters` after changing the movie
catalog. The generator is resumable, preserves usable local poster assets, and
writes a detailed `manifest.json` report plus a small `availability.json` index;
the gallery uses the index to avoid requesting missing images and displays its
generated fallback instead. On a managed
Windows network with TLS inspection, run Node with its system CA support.
If stored TMDB image paths have expired, set `TMDB_API_READ_TOKEN` before
running the command. The build-time generator will refresh those paths through
TMDB's movie-details API; the token is never exposed to the browser.
When legacy TMDB paths are unavailable, catalog preparation can use the movie's
IMDb ID to retrieve replacement artwork from MetaHub before normalizing and
hosting it locally.

This project includes movie information derived from the Full TMDB Movies Dataset on Kaggle, made available under the ODC Attribution License.

Movie imagery is loaded and displayed for discovery and preview purposes. The app links out to external movie resources where applicable.
